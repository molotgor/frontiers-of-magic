{"name":"Familiar","type":"ancestry","effects":[],"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>The chumfolk might not recognize it, but you are a brave warrior! To support your adventuring, you’ve enlisted the assistance of a chum—a buddy, an escort, and some days even a mount! (They call themselves “master,” but what are they master of?) This chum carries out the gruntwork of your adventure while you tend to the important dangers threatening the world.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accompany a master spellcaster, a warrior dabbling in magic, or a non-magical warrior you’ve developed a relationship with.</li>\n<li>Interact with your chum’s allies frequently or only when necessary.</li>\n<li>Develop a fascination and special bond with ordinary animals (the Unenlightened) around you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Address your chum exclusively instead of you… How irritating…</li>\n<li>Make you the party’s mascot or face.</li>\n<li>Expect you to sneak into danger they could just as well handle themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A familiar is a Tiny animal that has been transformed by a magic ritual. They might be marked by special patterns of spots or striations, a special light in the eyes, or a glowing nimbus.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Outside of magic academies and the biannual Gleaming Gathering, familiars don’t often encounter each other. Familiar culture is small enough and familiars have such a remarkable memory that two familiars who meet have at least heard of each other, if not met before. They have learned to convey vital information to each other over quick conversations as their chums speed along their divergent paths.</p>\n<p>The biannual Gleaming Gathering is held on the Dimension of Friendship, the same demiplane where pet cache pocket spaces are created. At the Gleaming Gathering, familiars trade stories, demonstrate newly found spells, exchange clues they’ve found, and mentor younger familiars. Most chums never even notice that their familiars have left for this crucial event, but their adventures would surely fall apart without it.</p>\n<h2>Alignments and Religion</h2>\n<p>Out of a desire to promote harmony, most familiars adopt an alignment identical to or adjacent to their chums. But most familiars can justify any decision to pursue their goal of defending the world against spiritual threats. Likewise, they tend to join their chums in corporate worship, but their ultimate destiny toward the Dimension of Friendship usually leaves them little interest in ecclesiastical goings-on. A notable exception to this tendency are the familiars of divine casters, who go to additional lengths to secure this relationship.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A familiar goes by two names: The name their chum bestows on them and their true name, used only in the Dimension of Friendship.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Familiar Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Traits </strong>Choose one of animal, plant, or aberration. If you choose plant, you can choose leshy ancestry feats. If you choose animal, you can choose ancestry feats from a similar ancestry (tengu if you’re a bird, ratfolk if you’re a rodent, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Tiny</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence or Wisdom as specified in your Heritage, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common and one of: Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Daemonic, Draconic, Infernal, Protean, Requian, Utopian.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it’s positive). Choose from any of the above and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region).</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> Low-Light Vision</p>\n<p><strong>Chum</strong> You gain a chum. Choose Tiny, Small, or Medium for your chum’s size. Your chum has the minion trait (although most familiars choose to never use that word), and a Speed of 25 feet. Choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and choose melee or ranged. Your chum gains an attack with these traits (and a range of 30 feet if you chose ranged) that deals 1d4 damage of the chosen type.<br />Your chum’s proficiency with any of their attacks matches your proficiency with your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) and uses your key ability score. If you have potency runes or striking runes on your handwraps of mighty blows, this attack gains these benefits, as well. Your chum can speak Common and one other language you do. Your chum’s save modifiers and AC are equal to yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or penalties. Their Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers are equal to your level plus your Charisma or spellcasting ability modifier (whichever is higher), and for other skills you’re trained in, their modifier is equal to your level.</p>\n<p>Your chum gets 8 Hit Points for each of your levels. You can communicate empathically with your chum as long as they’re within 1 mile of you, sharing emotions.</p>\n<p>If your chum dies, you can recruit a new chum after 1 week of mourning in the Dimension of Friendship.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Frontiers of Magic"},"rules":[{"key":"ChoiceSet","flag":"familiarTrait","prompt":"Choose Trait","choices":[{"label":"Animal","value":"animal"},{"label":"Plant","value":"plant"},{"label":"Aberration","value":"aberration"}]},{"key":"ActorTraits","add":["{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.familiarTrait}"]}],"slug":"familiar","schema":{"version":0.839,"lastMigration":null},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common"},"hp":6,"size":"tiny","reach":0,"speed":20,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int","wis"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["str"]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","daemonic","draconic","infernal","protean","requian","utopian"],"custom":""},"items":{"yBwrR":{"uuid":"Compendium.frontiers-of-magic.familiar-adventures-familiar-featfeatures.DkCRW0EwUPqtVtw6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feats.webp","name":"Chum","level":0}},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/familiar.svg","flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1685388558100,"modifiedTime":1685390270200,"lastModifiedBy":"Gh9U9I93FE4tnAIO"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gh9U9I93FE4tnAIO":3},"_id":"ZD76qiN0Hjj9Slj7"}
